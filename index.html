        </p> 

        <p class="hero-paragraph">Just completed the addition of a new section dedicated to practicing Hebrew words 
        from both Book 1 and Book 2 on our language study resource. This feature is designed to test your knowledge 
        after engaging with the vocabulary section.
        </p>
        
        <p class="hero-paragraph"> The concept is simple: you'll be presented with a single word, and you'll 
        have four options to choose from. If you correctly identify the word, you earn a point; if not, your 
        score decreases by two points. An additional benefit is the ability to practice each vocabulary set separately, 
        enhancing your preparation for upcoming classes. </p>

        <p class="hero-paragraph">  
            To give it a try, navigate to the "Practice" link on the menu and choose either Book 1 or Book 2. Within each book, 
            you'll find all the units listed. Alternatively, you can click here for <a href="practiceBook1.html">Book 1</a> or 
            here for <a href="practiceBook2.html">Book 2</a>.
