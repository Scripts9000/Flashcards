                knowledge
                after engaging with the vocabulary section.
            </p>

            <p class="hero-paragraph"> The concept is simple: you'll be presented with a single word, and you'll
                have four options to choose from. If you correctly identify the word, you earn a point; if not, your
                score decreases by two points. An additional benefit is the ability to practice each vocabulary set
                separately,
                enhancing your preparation for upcoming classes. </p>

            <p class="hero-paragraph">
                To give it a try, navigate to the "Practice" link on the menu and choose either Book 1 or Book 2. Within
                each book,
                you'll find all the units listed. Alternatively, you can click here for <a
