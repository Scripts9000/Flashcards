        <p class="hero-paragraph">Reading and writing Hebrew are unique experiences because the language is written and read from right to left. 
        Its alphabet has 22 letters, with 5 of them appearing differently at the end of words but pronounced the same way.
        Hebrew does not use capital letters, and it has only two sets of alphabets: Print and Script. Print is typically used for books, newspapers, 
        and street signs, while Script is commonly used for personal writing, such as letters and notes.
        All Hebrew letters are consonants, but some also function as vowels in certain cases. 
        Vowels are typically represented by a set of signs placed above, below, or alongside the letters. 
        These signs appear in holy scripts, poetry, and children's literature, and when studying the language. 
        However, everyday reading materials, like books, newspapers, and TV and film subtitles, do not include vowels. 
        This means that reading comprehension depends on familiarity with the words themselves, and one must know the word or context to read fluently.

        To add to the challenge, Hebrew is not a phonetic language, which means that one must be familiar with the word to read it accurately. 
        The sounds of three Hebrew letters (ב,כ,פ) depend on the presence or absence of a dot inside them. For example, unlike English, where F and P are two distinct sounds 
        and letters, in Hebrew, they are the same sound, and the only difference is the presence or absence of a dot in the letter.
        Despite these challenges, with practice, the Hebrew language can be read easily and logically, and one can appreciate its unique beauty and 
        cultural significance.
